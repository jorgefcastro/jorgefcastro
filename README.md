<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jorge </h1>
<p>Sometime ago I was thinking about to create a t-shirt store. 
I know that there are many platforms focused on it. But i wanted more, so i decide to learn about web developing and programming languages.
To build a more complete own domine, not just a market place, but a relationship and deep content place.</p>
